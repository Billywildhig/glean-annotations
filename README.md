# Glean Annotations

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean-annotations.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean-annotations)

This repository stores user-defined annotations against glean metrics: both those defined in applications (for example, "fenix" aka "Firefox for Android") as well as libraries like [android-components].

The published set of annotations is available at: https://mozilla.github.io/glean-annotations/api.json

## Local development
